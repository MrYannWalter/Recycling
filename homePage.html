                            <p>Liquide waste includes dirty water, wash water, organic liquide, waste detergents and
                                sometimes rain water.
                                This waste is usually found in households, bsuinesses and industries.

                            <h4 id="organic">Organic Waste</h4>
                            <p>Organic waste is also common in almost all households. This waste consists of food
                                waste, garden waste and so on.
                                While this waste is broken down by micro-organisms overtime, it still needs to be appropriately
                                disposed when generated.

                            <p>Hazard waste refers to any waste that's toxic, flammable, corrosif or reactif. Such
                                waste can be harmful
                                to both you and the environment. Exemples of hazardous waste include toxic chemicals and electronic
                                rubbish. </p>

                                commercial locations.
                                To understand this type of waste better, let's break it down into five categories:
                                <li class="solid">Plastic waste: bags, containers, jars, plastic bottles.</li>
                                <li class="solid">Paper or card waste: newspapers, packaging materials,cardboard etc. </li>
                                <li class="solid">Tins and metals: in different forms throughout your home.</li>
                                <li class="solid">Ceramics and glass: broken ceramic cups and plates, glass bottles etc</li>
                            </p>

                            <p> Recyclable rubbish as the name suggests refers to all waste that can be converted to
                                reusable products.
                                A significant percentage of items in construction waste such as masonry, metal, paper and furniture
                                can be recycled. </p>

                            Your waste managment process is sequenced in these few steps:
                        </p><br>
                            <p>
                                Firstly you will need various trash cans (at least three), which will each contain a specific category of waste.
                            </p><br>
                            <p>
                                Secondly each trash can must be identified for its purpose either by its color or by its name.
                                You can then sort your waste according to the categories mentioned above. 
                            </p><br>
                            <p>
                                Lastly you will need a garbage bag in order to facilitate its transportation.

            <p>
                In the fight for environmental protection, there are many local businesses and companies. As part of the management of household waste, 
                unlike HYSACAM which gets rid of waste, there are companies that recycle the various wastes that we produce. They use these waste as raw materials 
                and transform them into objects that are once again useful for humans.
